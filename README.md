i like to understand things that are difficult to understand

On a serious note, I like:
- Math
- Tweaking my editor (vim btw)
- Busch lattes
- Dad jokes (twins btw)
- Rust
- Golang
- Node (TypeScript)
- [Clean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)
- Large-scaled distributed systems
- Making things go fast
