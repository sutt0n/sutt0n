i like to understand things that are difficult to understand


On a serious note, I like:
- Rust
- Golang
- Node (TypeScript)
- Large-scaled distributed systems
- Having those distributed systems talk to each other (preferably in gRPC)
- Busch lattes

here's some emoji-ascii art i made on my phone while feeding one of my twins at 3:49am
```
      👁️  👁️
        👄   _
      /\|  /
    _/  |\/
       / \
      |_, \_,
